searchable. Define a `ransackable_attributes` class method in your `AdminUser`
model, watching out for items you DON'T want searchable (for
example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

```ruby

ActionView::Template::Error (Ransack needs AdminUser attributes explicitly allowlisted as
searchable. Define a `ransackable_attributes` class method in your `AdminUser`
model, watching out for items you DON'T want searchable (for
example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

```ruby

searchable. Define a `ransackable_attributes` class method in your `AdminUser`

example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

searchable. Define a `ransackable_attributes` class method in your `Customer`

example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

```ruby

searchable. Define a `ransackable_attributes` class method in your `Customer`

example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

```ruby

example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

```ruby

example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

```ruby

example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

```ruby

ActionView::Template::Error (Ransack needs Customer associations explicitly allowlisted as
searchable. Define a `ransackable_associations` class method in your `Customer`
model, watching out for items you DON'T want searchable (for
example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

```ruby
class Customer < ApplicationRecord

  # ...

  def self.ransackable_associations(auth_object = nil)
    []

model, watching out for items you DON'T want searchable (for
example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

```ruby

ActionView::Template::Error (Ransack needs ActiveStorage::Attachment attributes explicitly allowlisted as
searchable. Define a `ransackable_attributes` class method in your `ActiveStorage::Attachment`
model, watching out for items you DON'T want searchable (for
example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

```ruby
class ActiveStorage::Attachment < ApplicationRecord

  def self.ransackable_attributes(auth_object = nil)

ActionView::Template::Error (Ransack needs Customer associations explicitly allowlisted as
searchable. Define a `ransackable_associations` class method in your `Customer`
model, watching out for items you DON'T want searchable (for
example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

```ruby
class Customer < ApplicationRecord

  # ...

  def self.ransackable_associations(auth_object = nil)
    ["image_attachment", "image_blob"]
  end

  # ...

example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

```ruby

example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

```ruby

example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

```ruby

model, watching out for items you DON'T want searchable (for
example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

```ruby

example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

```ruby

example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

ActionView::Template::Error (Ransack needs ActiveStorage::Attachment attributes explicitly allowlisted as
searchable. Define a `ransackable_attributes` class method in your `ActiveStorage::Attachment`
model, watching out for items you DON'T want searchable (for
example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

```ruby
class ActiveStorage::Attachment < ApplicationRecord

  def self.ransackable_attributes(auth_object = nil)

ActionView::Template::Error (Ransack needs ActiveStorage::Attachment attributes explicitly allowlisted as
searchable. Define a `ransackable_attributes` class method in your `ActiveStorage::Attachment`
model, watching out for items you DON'T want searchable (for
example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

```ruby
class ActiveStorage::Attachment < ApplicationRecord

  def self.ransackable_attributes(auth_object = nil)

example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

```ruby

searchable. Define a `ransackable_associations` class method in your `Customer`
model, watching out for items you DON'T want searchable (for
example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

```ruby

searchable. Define a `ransackable_attributes` class method in your `ActiveStorage::Attachment`
model, watching out for items you DON'T want searchable (for
example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

```ruby

  def self.ransackable_attributes(auth_object = nil)

searchable. Define a `ransackable_associations` class method in your `Customer`
model, watching out for items you DON'T want searchable (for
example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

```ruby

  def self.ransackable_associations(auth_object = nil)

example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

searchable. Define a `ransackable_attributes` class method in your `ActiveStorage::Attachment`
model, watching out for items you DON'T want searchable (for
example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

```ruby

  def self.ransackable_attributes(auth_object = nil)

searchable. Define a `ransackable_attributes` class method in your `ActiveStorage::Attachment`
model, watching out for items you DON'T want searchable (for
example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

```ruby

model, watching out for items you DON'T want searchable (for
example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

```ruby

example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

ActionView::Template::Error (Ransack needs Customer associations explicitly allowlisted as
searchable. Define a `ransackable_associations` class method in your `Customer`
model, watching out for items you DON'T want searchable (for
example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

```ruby

searchable. Define a `ransackable_associations` class method in your `Customer`
model, watching out for items you DON'T want searchable (for
example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

```ruby

searchable. Define a `ransackable_associations` class method in your `Customer`
model, watching out for items you DON'T want searchable (for
example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

```ruby

searchable. Define a `ransackable_associations` class method in your `Customer`
model, watching out for items you DON'T want searchable (for
example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

```ruby

searchable. Define a `ransackable_associations` class method in your `Customer`
model, watching out for items you DON'T want searchable (for
example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

```ruby

ActionView::Template::Error (Ransack needs Customer associations explicitly allowlisted as
searchable. Define a `ransackable_associations` class method in your `Customer`
model, watching out for items you DON'T want searchable (for
example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

```ruby
class Customer < ApplicationRecord

  def self.ransackable_associations(auth_object = nil)

ActionView::Template::Error (Ransack needs Customer associations explicitly allowlisted as
searchable. Define a `ransackable_associations` class method in your `Customer`
model, watching out for items you DON'T want searchable (for
example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

```ruby

  def self.ransackable_associations(auth_object = nil)

ActionView::Template::Error (Ransack needs Customer associations explicitly allowlisted as
searchable. Define a `ransackable_associations` class method in your `Customer`
model, watching out for items you DON'T want searchable (for
example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

```ruby

ActionView::Template::Error (Ransack needs Customer associations explicitly allowlisted as
searchable. Define a `ransackable_associations` class method in your `Customer`
model, watching out for items you DON'T want searchable (for
example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

```ruby

ActionView::Template::Error (Ransack needs Customer associations explicitly allowlisted as
searchable. Define a `ransackable_associations` class method in your `Customer`
model, watching out for items you DON'T want searchable (for
example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

```ruby
class Customer < ApplicationRecord

  # ...

  def self.ransackable_associations(auth_object = nil)
    ["avatar_attachment", "avatar_blob"]

  # ...

ActionView::Template::Error (Ransack needs Customer associations explicitly allowlisted as
searchable. Define a `ransackable_associations` class method in your `Customer`
model, watching out for items you DON'T want searchable (for
example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

```ruby
class Customer < ApplicationRecord

  # ...

  def self.ransackable_associations(auth_object = nil)
    ["avatar_attachment", "avatar_blob"]

ActionView::Template::Error (Ransack needs Customer associations explicitly allowlisted as
searchable. Define a `ransackable_associations` class method in your `Customer`
model, watching out for items you DON'T want searchable (for
example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

```ruby
class Customer < ApplicationRecord

  def self.ransackable_associations(auth_object = nil)

model, watching out for items you DON'T want searchable (for
example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

```ruby

example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

```ruby
